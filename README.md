I'm a Computer Science & Engineering student at the **Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M)**. My work is guided by a simple but powerful principle: **technology should be a solution, not a barrier.**

As a visually impaired developer, I have a unique perspective on how technology can and should work. This experience drives my passion for Inclusive Design and fuels my commitment to building digital tools that are inherently accessible to everyone.
